                                    The SAMOKISH brand began its journey as a cherished hobby of a young designer
                                    Kateryna Samokish in 2010. Being a student, the designer made her first jewelry
                                    pieces for herself from all available materials she had at home like plastic beads,
                                    etc. From the very beginning people found her jewelry works unique and very
                                    different to what they could buy at that time. Then first orders came and Kateryna
                                    began developing her hobby while she was still a student.

                                    The style of SAMOKISH is recognizable due to the combination of natural stones of
                                    incredible beauty and Italian chains with anti-allergenic nickel-free coating that
                                    are
                                    also produced for the leading Italian fashion houses (Furla, Giuseppe Zanotti,
                                    Dsquared2).
                                </p>
                                <p> We use semi-precious stones, such as agates, amethysts, quartz, jasper, pearls and
                                    others. In wild nature two absolutely identical natural stones do not exist. Each
                                    stone
                                    is unique and unrepeatable. Every stone is carefully hand-selected by the designer
                                    Kateryna Basovskaya, and thatâ€™s why their beauty and versatility fascinate.</p>
